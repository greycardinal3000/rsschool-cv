## Profile
8+ years of diverse experience in the music industry: editorial, content curation and programming, digital distribution, marketing and project management. Was lucky to transform my passion for music into a lifework. Took my path from major label through music distributor to streaming service, which allowed me to learn all the processes inside out and to become an all-rounded music industry professional. Tend to improve my editorial skills permanently, therefore always stand on the cutting edge of the music trends. Appreciate people I work with, value their time and resources. Open-minded, with developed interpersonal skills, well-organized in work processes and personal life.
